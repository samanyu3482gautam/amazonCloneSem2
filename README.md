# Amazon Clone - Group Project

## 📖 Project Description

We are a group of Bachelor of Engineering students specializing in **Computer Science** and **Artificial Intelligence** from **Chitkara University**, Punjab, Rajpura, India. Currently, we are in our **Semester 2** and have created this project as part of our group work. The members of the group are:

- **Samanyu Gautam**
- **Tanisha Garg**
- **Yashita Bansal**
- **Palak Bisht**

### 🚀 About The Project

This project is an **Amazon Clone** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Flask**. The primary focus of the project is the **Flask backend development**, where we have implemented several important features such as:

- **App Routing**
- **Rendering Templates**
- **Redirect URLs for login pages**
- **Permanent and Temporary Sessions**
- **Database Integration**

The main aim of this project was to replicate the structure and functionality of Amazon’s website as closely as possible, specifically the e-commerce pages, login pages, and user sessions.

### 💻 Technologies Used

The technologies used for developing this Amazon clone are:

- **HTML** – For building the structure and layout of the pages.
- **CSS** – For styling and creating responsive web pages.
- **Flask** – For the backend development, including routing, sessions, database handling, and more.

We have also set up the entire project on a **Python Virtual Environment**, ensuring that all dependencies are contained and easily manageable.

### 🔧 Key Features

- **Homepage** – The landing page that mimics Amazon's interface.
- **Login & Registration Pages** – User login and registration functionality with session management.
- **Product Pages** – A catalog-like page to display products.
- **Cart and Checkout** – An implementation of a shopping cart and checkout process.
- **Database Integration** – Storing user details, product data, and session management.

### 🛠️ Flask Features

In the backend, we’ve utilized Flask for:

- **Routing**: The app is divided into different routes for homepage, login, product display, etc.
- **Session Management**: We handle temporary and permanent user sessions, allowing users to stay logged in.
- **Database**: A simple database for storing user information, cart data, etc.
  
### 🌐 How to Access

The code for this project is **publicly available** on **GitHub**. You can clone the repository or view the code and documentation as needed.

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment.
3. Install required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the app with `python app.py`.

### 💡 Future Improvements

While we’ve managed to create a close replica of the Amazon website, some areas for future improvement include:

- Enhancing the **product search** and **filter** functionality.
- Implementing **payment gateway integration**.
- Improving the **UI/UX design** to make it more responsive and polished.
